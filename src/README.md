## Sync Command

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The sync command is being reimagined as a new API endpoint that will perform synchronization between spaces. This new implementation will provide:
> - Faster synchronization compared to the current CLI version
> - Improved reliability by running on our backend servers
> - Better handling of large-scale synchronization operations

If you wish to continue using the `sync` command, please refer to the [v3](https://github.com/storyblok/storyblok-cli/tree/v3?tab=readme-ov-file#sync) documentation and use `storyblok@v3.36.1` or previous.

| Option | Description | Default |

| `--ci` | Enable CI mode (coming soon) | `false` |

> [!TIP]
> When reporting a bug or opening a support ticket, please run the command with the `--verbose` flag and add the output to it. This will help us better understand and resolve the issue.
